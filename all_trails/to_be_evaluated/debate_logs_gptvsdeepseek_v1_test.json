Instead of making it free, we could improve affordability and accessibility for those in need, ensuring resources are wisely allocated and services remain sustainable. This targeted approach could effectively support the elderly and disabled.",
        "LLaMA-3: Targeted support is a good start, but administrative costs of means-testing could be high, potentially offsetting benefits, and still leaving some vulnerable groups behind.",
        "GPT-4: Yes, administrative costs can be a concern. Streamlining processes and using existing data can minimize expenses. Combining targeted support with partnerships with community organizations might ensure more efficient, inclusive assistance for vulnerable groups.",
        "LLaMA-3: Partnerships are a good idea, but what about areas with limited community resources or organizations? Free transportation could be a more comprehensive solution."
